# ðŸ“‚ folders-sync-app

A simple program to synchronize your **Source** and **Replica** folders.

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- The **Source** folder is your main folder, containing the original files.
- The **Replica** folder is a synchronized copy of the Source folder.
- Changes from the Source are automatically synced to the Replica at a defined interval.

---

## ðŸ›  Usage

Before starting:
- Create your **Source** and **Replica** folders manually.

To run the app from the command line, use:

```bash
.\folders_sync.exe "D:\Source" "D:\Replica" 30 "D:\Logs\sync_log.txt"
```

Where:

"D:\Source" â€” path to your Source folder.

"D:\Replica" â€” path to your Replica folder.

30 â€” synchronization interval in seconds.

"D:\Logs\sync_log.txt" â€” path to the log file where synchronization events are recorded.
